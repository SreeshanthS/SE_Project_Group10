- Course: Software Engineering – SEMTZC344
- Section: A
- Group Number: [10]
- SDG Option 2 - No Hunger
# Project Overview
It is a simple, user-friendly web platform that connects food donors (like restaurants, hostels, and event organizers) with nearby NGOs and shelters to reduce food waste and distribute surplus food to the needy efficiently.
This platform is developed as part of the Software Engineering course and serves as a capstone application for applying real-world software development methodologies.
# Problem Statement
India faces widespread hunger despite massive daily food wastage. There is no efficient system to link surplus food sources with those in need, leading to both food loss and unaddressed hunger.
